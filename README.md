📊 Key Insights

Total Sales reached $11.67bn, generating a profit of $2.33bn with a strong ROI of 25%.

Property prices increase with bedroom count, peaking around 7–8 bedrooms, before declining.

Sqft Living has a strong positive correlation with price, especially for waterfront properties.

The majority of properties (99.25% / 21.45K units) are non-waterfront.

Most transactions fall within the $200K–$600K price range, indicating a mid-market dominant demand.

Seasonal trends show price fluctuations across months, with notable increases toward early 2015.

The Decomposition Tree highlights how bedrooms, grade, view, and condition collectively impact average prices.
